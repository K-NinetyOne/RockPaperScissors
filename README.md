# RockPaperScissors
The Odin Project: Console based Rock Paper Scissors game written with Javascript.

This project will have the following steps 
- Have the computer randomly choose from 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'.
- Prompt the user for case-insensitive input to choose 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'.
- Play 5 round of Rock Paper Scissors and increment the scores based on the round winner.
- Declare a winner at the end.

The project brief does not require the use of arrays, loops or error handling for invaid user input. 

Project completed according to project specifications and working in browser console (Firefox and Chromium). 
Initially working with playRound and score variables outside of playGame function but now rearranged so they exist inside playGame as the project requires.
